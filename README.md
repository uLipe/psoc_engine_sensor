# PSOC analog coprocessor engine speed sensor

This project aims to build a camshaft speed sensor based on noise
generated by the engine periodic ignition event, the funny part 
is to use a single pin plus a deocupling capacitor to do that,
thanks to the psoc analog coprocessor supplied by hackster, below
you'll find instructions how to build the firmware.

# Dependencies
- PSoC Creator 3.3 or above: http://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-creator-integrated-design-environment-ide

- You need PSOC analog coprocessor hardware to run this firmware:

# How to build:
- open the psoc creator the file->open->project/workspace;
- clone this repository;
- find this directory and go inside the .cydsn folder;
- select the project file then click ok;
- to build only, hit F6 or build engine_speed_sensor;
- to debug (if you have a debugger or a pioneer kit) hit F5.
- enjoy!
